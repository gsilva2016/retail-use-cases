### Example output
# The video starts with a static image of a stainless steel sink against a patterned tile background. Shortly after, hands enter the frame and begin washing at the faucet, which is turned on. The hands are seen manipulating water to cleanse, with visible soap suds forming as they rub together and over the skin. Throughout the sequence, the focus remains on the handwashing process without any camera movement or change in perspective.
